# Journey to This Site: Be A Friend of Time

I began recording life in diary books at around the age of ten. Carrying diary books everywhere was not easy, so I created a personal blog in 2006. I wrote over one hundred posts and uploaded hundreds of photos and pieces of music all online, with which my blog reached the top 100 in WangYi community. I permanently lost those original records in around 2018 when the blog server was no longer maintained. After the loss, I decided to build a personal website: starting from a local server, then creating a World Wide Web site hosted by WordPress. When the hosting costs became unsustainable, I finally decided to completely rebuild the website using CSS/HTML/JS. I am deeply grateful that, after decades, I still carry the same passion, calmness and love—as the little child in the remote mountain village—to record small things in life.
