# Journey to This Site: Be A Friend of Time

I began recording life in diary books at the age of ten. In 2006, I launched a personal blog where I authored over one hundred posts, reaching the Top 100 in the WangYi community before the 2010s. I permanently lost those original records in around 2018 when the blog server was no longer maintained. That loss motivated me to build my own plateform: I started with a local server, moved to a WordPress site, and eventually committed to the "hard work" of rebuilding the entire site from scratch using CSS/HTML/JS to ensure long-term sustainability. I am deeply grateful that, after decades, I still carry the same passion, calmness and love—as the little child in the remote mountain village—to record small things in life.
