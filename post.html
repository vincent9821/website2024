        <h1> Project PI#1: Stokastic Load on Offshore Piles (SLOOP) </h1>
        <em> May 22nd, 2025 </em>
        <p> SLOOP Project receives funding from ORACLE Labex. It gathers local researchers at the Nantes region, and international experts from Brasil, France and USA. The project will investigate the stokastic loads exerted on offshore piles through aero-hydrodynamic simulations, and the pile deflections through centrifuge tests (SOLCYP+ project) and geotechnical modelling. Here is the dedicated web-page for the project. </p>
